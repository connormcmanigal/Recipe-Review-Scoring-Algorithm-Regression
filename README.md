# Recipe Review Sentiment Analysis and ML Project
### Connor McManigal, Peyton Politewicz, and Harold Ng

## Overview:

- This project's primary objective is to predict the best score of a recipe review, a metric utilized by social media websites to determine the order in which comments appear. We leverage VADER and TextBlob sentiment analysis libraries to obtain polarity scores and subjectivity scores of these reviews, aiming to enhance performance metrics through the incorporation of additional data. We used MLP and Gradient Boosting Regressors as our algorithms, and we evaluated their performance using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
