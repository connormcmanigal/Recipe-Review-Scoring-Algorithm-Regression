## Overview:

This project's primary objective is to predict the best score of a recipe review, a metric utilized by social media websites to determine the order in which comments appear. We create new features with the existing data and leverage VADER and TextBlob sentiment analysis libraries to obtain polarity and subjectivity scores reviews, aiming to enhance performance metrics through the incorporation of additional data. We used MLP and Gradient Boosting Regressors as our algorithms, and we evaluated their performance using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error.
